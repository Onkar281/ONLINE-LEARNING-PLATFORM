EduSphere is a simple and beginner-friendly online learning website that I created as part of Task 2 during my internship at CodTech. This project is a fresh version of a platform I had earlier developed called CyberLearn. While the basic idea remains similar, EduSphere was specially built for a friend with a new name, updated design, different color scheme, and completely new quiz content. The main goal of this task was to practice building a full-featured educational web interface using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external libraries or frameworks. The website includes a homepage with a clean layout that introduces EduSphere and explains its main features in a clear and user-friendly way. There is a hero section that welcomes users and describes the purpose of the platform, followed by a section that highlights key features such as flexible learning options, expert support, progress tracking, and certificates on course completion. I also added an interactive quiz consisting of three multiple-choice questions. Users can take the quiz and instantly receive feedback on which answers were right or wrong, along with their total score. This feature is handled entirely using vanilla JavaScript, and it helped me practice logic building and DOM manipulation. Additionally, the platform includes a basic login page where users can enter their email and password. Although it doesnâ€™t connect to a real server, the form checks if all fields are filled and shows a success message before sending users back to the homepage. The entire layout is responsive and adjusts well on different screen sizes, thanks to pure CSS styling. EduSphere uses a soft teal-green color palette, which gives it a fresh and modern look, very different from the blue tones used in CyberLearn. Through building this project, I learned more about handling user input, writing clean code, and building interactive web pages from scratch. It also gave me hands-on experience working on file organization and testing through VS Code and my local terminal. I plan to improve this project in the future by adding user registration, lesson videos, a backend system, and more advanced features.
